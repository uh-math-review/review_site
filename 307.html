<p> <Strong> Course Objectives </Strong> Upon successful completion of Math 307, a student will have a basic understanding of Linear Algebra, apply Linear Algebra to solve problems, and be able to solve linear differential equations via eignevalue and eigenvectors method. </p>
<hr>
<Strong> Program Objectives: </Strong> Linear algebra is one of the basic and foundational topics in mathematics. It is applied in many other fields. The course is intended for non-majors who need
to understand the basic principles and apply them in to solve systems of linear differential
equations.
