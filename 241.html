<p> <Strong> Course Objectives: </Strong> Upon successful completion of Math 241 the student will have an understanding of the above listed topics, be able to
solve routine problems, and be able to apply the ideas.<br/>
<Strong> Program Objectives: </Strong> In this introductory level course students learn
the basics about differentiation and integration of functions in one variable. The approach is more computational than theoretical. The course material is fundamental for majors in mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering. The course is the first in a four (three) semester
sequence.
